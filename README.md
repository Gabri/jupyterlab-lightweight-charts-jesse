# jupyterlab-lightweight-charts-jesse
lightweight-charts integration with jupyterlab, using jesse framework to import candles and and use indicators but you can do it with other libraries and sources

This repository comes with idea and initial source of [lightweight-charts-jupyter-bridge](https://github.com/tartakovsky/lightweight-charts-jupyter-bridge) of tartakovsky. Big thanks to him.

I added some new features like to the library `lightweight.py`:
- Candlestick chart
- Volume histogram
- Line indicators with same timeframe of candles
- Line indicators with an higher timeframe
- Dark Theme parameter (optional)
- Width and Height parameter (optional)

In the jupyterlab file I set:
- wide view of cells (why using them so small?  :) )
